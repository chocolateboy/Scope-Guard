Scope-Guard version 0.03
========================

This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms of resource
management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful when dealing with exceptions:
the Scope::Guard constructor takes a reference to a subroutine that is guaranteed to
be called even if the thread of execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows
lexically-scoped "promises" to be made that are automatically honoured by perl's garbage
collector.
